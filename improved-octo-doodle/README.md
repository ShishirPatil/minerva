# Improved Octo-Doodle

This repository contains the code which manages container
updates in `src/container_update/`. Examples can be found
within `src/apps`. Within the base directory of any app, executing
`../../container-update/run.sh` will build and flash the
code for that update to a `nrf52840`.
